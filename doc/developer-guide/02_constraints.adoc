== Constraints

=== Data types and time

* Prefer double over float
* Always save time duration in seconds and with double
* Always save timestamps in nanoseconds and with long.
Get the current timestamp from the current world frame, not from `System.nanoTime()` if possible
* Measure time by remembering the start timestamp and calculating the difference to the current timestamp (or use `TimestampTimer`)
* Never use `System.currentTimeMillis()` for time measurement. `System.nanoTime()` is much faster, because it does not depend on the system clock.
* Calculate time difference by `(t1 - t2) / 1e9`, not with TimeUnit.
TimeUnit only has integral numbers.
