== Introduction and Goals

Sumatra is our main software framework that is running on the team laptop during a match.

It receives data from https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/ssl-vision[SSL-vision], filters the data in the World-Predictor, makes decisions in the AI and sends commands to the bots with the Bot-Manager.

=== Requirements

* Sumatra is written in Java
* Sumatra must be able to process all data in real time

=== Quality Goals

* Keep modules separated and number of dependencies low
* Do not introduce new SonarQube issues

=== Maintainers
