This is the central AI software of TIGERs Mannheim. It is called Sumatra.
We use Maven for building the application. You can also use IntelliJ or Eclipse to build and run it.
Dependencies will be downloaded from Maven repositories, so you need an internet connection for the first build.

System Requirements
 * Java JDK 8
 * Maven
 * Internet connection
 * no limitations on OS known

Build:
run "mvn install" from command line

Run:
Use the run.sh script to run without an IDE or use the provided launch configs for IntelliJ or Eclipse.

For more detailed information about compiling and running Sumatra, have a look at our AutoReferee implementation which is based on Sumatra:
http://gitlab.tigers-mannheim.de/open-source/AutoReferee

There is an internal simulator that can be used without any external dependencies.
We also provide a modified version of grSim (original: https://github.com/mani-monaj/grSim) which is compatible with Sumatra. However, we do not use or maintain it anymore.
It can be found on our homepage.

You can run AI against AI within one Sumatra instance. After pressing the run button, you can use the original refbox or the ref view in Sumatra to start a game.
Make sure you configure "moduli_sumatra" in the menu bar for simulation.
There are additional moduli configs for example to use shared radio. 
Most configs can be found in the config view.
